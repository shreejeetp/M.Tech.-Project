# M.Tech. Project

## Directoried
`my` folder contains the GGA we created as part of this project, `tan` folder contains the GGA we implemented of Tan et al. work. `plot` contains a script which plots the results of both GGA against each other.

## How to run

`Change directory configuration on top of each python script before running it.`

There's a python script inside both `my` and `tan` folders which compiles, execute and saves the output of the program in `res/output`.

To plot the results, obtained by the output, run the python script inside `plot`. set the `minFlag` inside it to plot the best results.
